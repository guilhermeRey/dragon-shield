A project made for fun.
######Playing with javascript to build a custom dungeon and dragons master's shield, for table-top Role Playing Games.

It was used in one of my campaigns, i used the master app and used a projector to show the realtime route view to my friends.
The project contains information about the history we were playing, but you're welcome to fork the repo and do whatever you want: delete all, use some, etc :)
